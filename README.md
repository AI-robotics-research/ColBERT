# ColBERT: Contextualized Late Interaction over BERT

This is version 0.2.0 of the reference implementation of the SIGIR'20 paper **ColBERT: Efficient and Effective Passage Search via Contextualized Late Interaction over BERT**. This version is a near-complete rewrite with lots of additional functionality and considerably higher efficiency.

The installation and use instructions will be updated soon; in the meanwhile, feel free to use the original v0.1 code. 

ColBERT (new version 0.2.x) requires Python 3.7 and Pytorch 1.6 and uses [HuggingFace Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) 3.0.
